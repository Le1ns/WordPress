  <li>docker-compose: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-debian-10-ru</li>

  After i tryed to make container 'Hello world' - OK go next step.
  
 For creating site on WordPress i userd guid: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-docker-compose-ru
 
 At first, i had trouble with domain. I tryed to use domain like le1ns13.wordpress.com or le1ns13ru.wordpress.com but i couldnt unite my local server and my wordpress domain.
 It was a big problem because the part of task is SSL cert and it depend form domain address.
 Few times i ruined my project and started again.
 
 The next day i decide to buy my own domain. I think it s good experience btw. It cost just 100 rubles. So, i bought altezza34.space because my car is Altezza xD
 
 I bought it on Reg.ru and i got access to DNS list. I united ip addres with server and domain and great! It works!
